# The Cocktail Recipe Database Project

I am building a simple database for a non-GUI cocktail book.

### Features Wishlist

* Stores drink name, ingredients and their amounts (with units of measurement), garnish, serving style, and drink vessel used.
* Allows user to search for recipes based on one or more ingredients; returns as a list with the drink name and ingredients (nothing more).
* User inputs drink name and recipe is returned as described in first bullet above.
* User can add drink recipes.
* User can add their own ingredients to a "bar" and sort for drinks they can make with said ingredients.
* Drink output can be randomized to give the user a "surprise" recipe.
